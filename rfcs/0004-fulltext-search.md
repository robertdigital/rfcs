## Summary

This RFC proposes adding a fulltext search filter type to the GraphQL API 
to allow subgraph developers to specify language-specific, lexical, 
composite filters that end users can use in their queries. The fulltext 
index will be created by examining all words in a document, breaking it 
into individul words and phrases (lexical analysis), and collapsing 
variations of words into a single index term (stemming.)

## Goals & Motivation

The current set of string filters available in our GraphQL API is lacking 
the tools needed to build effective, modern interfaces. Wildcard string 
matching does provide string filtering, but users have come to expect the 
easy to use filtering that comes with fulltext search systems.

To facilitate building effective user interfaces we must provide human-user 
friendly query filtering. Lexical, composite fulltext search filters can 
provide the tools necessary for front-end developers to implement powerful 
search bars that filter data across multiple fields of an Entity.

With the proposed feature I aim to:
  - provide tools for subgraph developers to define composite search 
    indexes that search across multiple fields in an entity, and
  - integrate powerful, user friendly text search that is flexible and 
    can be easily defined by a subgraph developer ultimately providing 
    the tools necesssary for front end developers to create effective 
    user interfaces without the need to middleware.
     
## Urgency

A delay in adding the fulltext search feature  will not create issues with 
current deployments. However, it will represent a realization of part of 
the long term vision for the query network. Also several high profile users 
have communicated that it may be a conversion blocker, so implementation 
should be prioritized. 

## Terminology

- `lexeme`: a basic lexical unit of a language, consisting of one word or 
  several words, considered as an abstract unit, and applied to a family 
  of words related by form or meaning.
- `morphology (linguistics)`: the study of words, how they are formed, 
  and their relationship to other words in the same language. 
- `fulltext search index`: the result of lexical and morphological 
  analysis (stemming) of a set of text documents.  It provides frequency 
  and location for the language-specific stems found in the text documents 
  being indexed. 

## Detailed Design

### Subgraph Definition

Part of the power of fulltext search indexes are their flexibility, so 
it is important to expose a simple interface to facilitate useful 
applications of the index and ulimately aim to reduce the need to create 
new subgraphs for the express purpose of updating fulltext search fields 
for end-use cases. 

For each fulltext search index a subgraph developer must be able to specify:
    1. a language, 
    2. a set of text document fields to include,
    3. relative weighting for each field in the index.

The proposed process of adding a fulltext search index to an Entity 
involves adding a special field to that Entity in the GraphQL schema of 
the subgraph's definition. The subgraph developer will create a new virtual 
field of type String that is marked with the special `@FullTextSearch` directive. 
The directive will have two required parameters for specifying the language
 and the fields to be incorporated. Verification of the index definition 
 will ensure that all fields referenced are valid String type fields on 
 that entity. To be clear, the proposed interface will add the fulltext 
 search definitions to the subgraph deployment hash, so adding or updating 
 a fulltext search index will require an update to the subgraph.  
 With subgraph composition it will be possible to easily create new subgraphs 
 that add specific fulltext search indexes to an existing subgraph. 

Example fulltext search field definition:
```graphql
type ExampleItem @entity {
    id: ID!,
    name: String!,
    description: String!,
    specs: String!,
    address: Bytes!,
    marked: Boolean!,
    itemSearch: String! @fullTextSearchIndex(language: "english", fields: [{name: "name", weight: 5}, {name: "description", weight: 3}, {name: "specs", weight: 1}])
}
```  

### GraphQL Query interface

For each fulltext index three search algorithms will be made available to 
the end user: a simple text query, a standard ranking, and a cover 
density ranking algorithm: 
  - `query`: search for the string in the indexed document. Several 
    operators available: and, or, and proximity (`&`, `|`, `<->`.) 
    The proximity operator allows one to specify max distance: 
    3 words apart â†’ `<3>`. (filter suffix = ``)
  - `standard ranking`: ranking based on the number of matching lexemes. 
    (filter suffix = `_rank`)
  - `cover density ranking`: Cover density is similar to the standard 
    fulltext search ranking except that the proximity of matching lexemes 
    to each other is taken into consideration. This function requires 
    lexeme positional information to perform its calculation, so it ignores 
    any "stripped" lexemes in the index.
    (filter suffix = `_rank_cd`)
    
Example Usage in a query (references the example Entity definition from above section): 
```graphql
query {
    exampleItems(first: 10, where: {itemSearch_rank_cd: "sarcastic"}) {
        address
        name 
        description
    }
}
```

### Tools and Design

Fulltext search query system implementations often involve specific systems 
for storing and querying the text documents; however, in an effort to reduce 
system complexity and feature implemtation time I propose starting with the 
fulltext search features built in to PostgreSQL.

A FullText search field will get its own column in the Entity table just 
like any other field; however, the data stored will be the result of the 
lexical, morphological analysis of text documents performed on the fields 
included in the index. The fulltext search field will be created using 
Postgres ts_vector function and will be indexed using a GIN index. 
The GraphQL query interface will expose PostgreSQL's to_tsquery(), 
ts_rank(), and ts_rank_cd() functions in a pretty direct manner 
(see the GraphQL Query Interface section above for details) for querying 
the indexed fulltext search data.  
 

Limitations of Postgres fulltext search indexes and search algorithms: 
  - only certain languages available (expandable with plugins namely PGroonga), 
  - select algorithms are available, and 
  - limited to PostgreSQL storage. 

Alternative technologies (not in any particular order): 
  Written in Rust:
    - Tantivy (https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy)
    - Toshi (https://github.com/toshi-search/Toshi)
    - Sonic (https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic)
    - MeiliSearch (https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch)
    - Bayard (https://github.com/bayard-search/bayard)

## Compatibility

This proposal does not change any existing interfaces, so no migrations 
will be necessary for existing subgraph deployments. 

## Drawbacks and Risks

There is little risk in implementing this feature.  The proposed solution 
uses native Postgres fulltext features and there is a nonzero probability 
this choice results in slower than optimal write and read times; 
however the tradeoff in implementation time/complexity and the existence 
of production use case testimonials tempers my apprehension here. 

Are there any desired "fulltext search like" capabilities that I've missed in this proposal?   

## Alternatives

An alternative design for the feature would allow more flexibility for 
Graph Node operators in their index implementation and create a marketplace 
for indexes. This design moved the definition of custom indexes out of the 
subgraph definition; the subgraph would be deployed without them and they 
could be added later using a new Graph Explorer interface (in Hosted-Service context) 
or a JSON-RPC request directly to a Graph Node. One of the benefits of this 
design is that the definition of uniqueness for a subgraph does not include 
the custom indexes, so a new subgraph deployment and corresponding syncing 
work does not have to be added in order to create or update an index. 
However, it also introduces significant added complexity: will a separate 
query marketplace and discovery registry then be required for finding nodes 
with your needed subgraph-index combination.  

## Open Questions

Full-text search queries introduce new issues with maintaining query 
result determinism which will become a more potent issue with the 
decentralized network. A fulltext search query and a dataset are not enough 
to determine the output of the query, the index is vital to establish a 
deterministic causal relationship to the output data.  Query verification 
will need to take into account the query, the index, the underlying dataset, 
and the query result.  Can we find a healthy compromise between being 
prescriptive about the indexes and algorithms in order to allow formal 
verification and allowing indexer node operators to experiment with 
algorithms and indexes in order to continue to improve query speed and results? 

Since a fulltext search field is purely derivative of other Entity data 
the addition or update of a @fullTextSearchIndex field does not require a 
full blockchain resync, rather the index itself just needs to be rebuilt. 
How can we allow fulltext search index (and eventually other index types) 
updates without requiring a full subgraph resync?
