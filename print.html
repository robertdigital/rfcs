<h1><a class="header" href="#rfcs" id="rfcs">RFCs</a></h1>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-rfc" id="what-is-an-rfc">What is an RFC?</a></h2>
<p>An RFC describes a change to Graph Protocol, for example a new feature. Any
substantial change goes through the RFC process, where the change is described
in an RFC, is proposed a pull request to the <code>rfcs</code> repository, is reviewed,
currently by the core team, and ultimately is either either approved or
rejected.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#rfc-process" id="rfc-process">RFC process</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#1-create-a-new-rfc" id="1-create-a-new-rfc">1. Create a new RFC</a></h3>
<p>RFCs are numbered, starting at <code>0001</code>. To create a new RFC, create a new branch
of the <code>rfcs</code> repository. Check the existing RFCs to identify the next number to
use. Then, copy the <a href="https://github.com/graphprotocol/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0000-template.md">RFC
template</a>
to a new file in the <code>rfcs/</code> directory. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cp rfcs/0000-template.md rfcs/0015-fulltext-search.md
</code></pre>
<p>Write the RFC, commit it to the branch and open a <a href="https://github.com/graphprotocol/rfcs/pulls">pull
request</a> in the <code>rfcs</code> repository.</p>
<p>In addition to the RFC itself, the pull request must include the following
changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a link to the RFC on the <a href="rfcs/./approved.html">Approved RFCs</a> page, and</li>
<li>a link to the RFC under <code>Approved RFCs</code> in <code>SUMMARY.md</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#2-rfc-review" id="2-rfc-review">2. RFC review</a></h3>
<p>After an RFC has been submitted through a pull request, it is being reviewed. At
the time of writing, every RFC needs to be approved by</p>
<ul>
<li>at least one Graph Protocol founder, and</li>
<li>at least one member of the core development team.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#3-rfc-approval" id="3-rfc-approval">3. RFC approval</a></h3>
<p>Once an RFC is approved, the RFC meta data (see the

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary" id="summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Subgraph composition enables referencing, extending and querying entities across
subgraph boundaries.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#goals--motivation" id="goals--motivation">Goals &amp; Motivation</a></h2>
<p>The high-level goal of subgraph composition is to be able to compose subgraph
schemas and data hierarchically. Imagine umbrella subgraphs that combine all the
data from a domain (e.g. DeFi, job markets, music) through one unified, coherent
API. This could allow reuse and governance at different levels and go all the
way to the top, fulfilling the vision of <em>the</em> Graph.</p>
<p>The ability to reference, extend and query entities across subgraph boundaries
enables several use cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Linking entities across subgraphs.</li>
<li>Extending entities defined in other subgraphs by adding new fields.</li>
<li>Breaking down data silos by composing subgraphs and defining richer schemas
without indexing the same data over and over again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Subgraph composition is needed to avoid duplicated work, both in terms of
developing subgraphs as well as indexing them. It is an essential part of the
overall vision behind The Graph, as it allows to combine isolated subgraphs into
a complete, connected graph of the (decentralized) world's data.</p>
<p>Subgraph developers will benefit from the ability to reference data from other
subgraphs, saving them development time and enabling richer data models. dApp
developers will be able to leverage this to build more compelling applications.
Node operators will benefit from subgraph composition by having better insight
into which subgraphs are queried together, allowing them to make more informed
decisions about which subgraphs to index.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#urgency" id="urgency">Urgency</a></h2>
<p>Due to the high impact of this feature and its important role in fulfilling the
vision behind The Graph, it would be good to start working on this as early as
possible.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#terminology" id="terminology">Terminology</a></h2>
<p>The feature is referred to by <em>query-time subgraph composition</em>, short:
<em>subgraph composition</em>. </p>
<p>Terms introduced and used in this RFC:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Imported schema</em>: The schema of another subgraph from which types are
imported.</li>
<li><em>Imported type</em>: An entity type imported from another subgraph schema.</li>
<li><em>Extended type</em>: An entity type imported from another subgraph schema and
extended in the subgraph that imports it.</li>
<li><em>Local schema</em>: The schema of the subgraph that imports from another subgraph.</li>
<li><em>Local type</em>: A type defined in the local schema.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#detailed-design" id="detailed-design">Detailed Design</a></h2>
<p>The sections below make the assumption that there is a subgraph with the name
<code>ethereum/mainnet</code> that includes an <code>Address</code> entity type.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#composing-subgraphs-by-importing-types" id="composing-subgraphs-by-importing-types">Composing Subgraphs By Importing Types</a></h3>
<p>In order to reference entity types from annother subgraph, a developer would
first import these types from the other subgraph's schema.</p>
<p>Types can be imported either from a subgraph name or from a subgraph ID.
Importing from a subgraph name means that the exact version of the imported
subgraph will be identified at query time and its schema may change in arbitrary
ways over time. Importing from a subgraph ID guarantees that the schema will
never change but also means that the import points to a subgraph version that
may become outdated over time.</p>
<p>Let's say a DAO subgraph contains a <code>Proposal</code> type that has a <code>proposer</code> field
that should link to an Ethereum address (think: Ethereum accounts or contracts)
and a <code>transaction</code> field that should link to an Ethereum transaction. The
developer would then write the DAO subgraph schema as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">type _Schema_
  @import(
    types: [&quot;Address&quot;, { name: &quot;Transaction&quot;, as: &quot;EthereumTransaction&quot; }],
    from: { name: &quot;ethereum/mainnet&quot; }
  )

type Proposal @entity {
  id: ID!
  proposer: Address!
  transaction: EthereumTransaction!
}
</code></pre>
<p>This would then allow queries that follow the references to addresses and
transactions, like</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">{
  proposals { 
    proposer {
      balance
      address
    }
    transaction {
      hash
      block {
        number
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#extending-types-from-imported-schemas" id="extending-types-from-imported-schemas">Extending Types From Imported Schemas</a></h3>
<p>Extending types from another subgraph involves several steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Importing the entity types from the other subgraph.</li>
<li>Extending these types with custom fields.</li>
<li>Managing (e.g. creating) extended entities in subgraph mappings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's say the DAO subgraph wants to extend the Ethereum <code>Address</code> type to
include the proposals created by each respective account. To achieve this, the
developer would write the following schema:</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">type _Schema_
  @import(
    types: [&quot;Address&quot;],
    from: { name: &quot;ethereum/mainnet&quot; }
  )

type Proposal @entity {
  id: ID!
  proposer: Address!
}

extend type Address {
  proposals: [Proposal!]! @derivedFrom(field: &quot;proposal&quot;)
}
</code></pre>
<p>This makes queries like the following possible, where the query can go &quot;back&quot;
from addresses to proposal entities, despite the Ethereum <code>Address</code> type
originally being defined in the <code>ethereum/mainnet</code> subgraph.</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">{
  addresses {
    id
    proposals {
      id
      proposer {
        id
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above case, the <code>proposals</code> field on the extended type is derived, which
means that an implementation wouldn't have to create a local extension type in
the store. However, if <code>proposals</code> was defined as</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">extend type Address {
  proposals: [Proposal!]!
}
</code></pre>
<p>then it would the subgraph mappings would have to create partial <code>Address</code>
entities with <code>id</code> and <code>proposals</code> fields for all addresses from which proposals
were created. At query time, these entity instances would have to be merged with
the original <code>Address</code> entities from the <code>ethereum/mainnet</code> subgraph.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#subgraph-availability" id="subgraph-availability">Subgraph Availability</a></h3>
<p>In the decentralized network, queries will be split and routed through the
network based on what indexers are available and which subgraphs they index. At
that point, failure to find an indexer for a subgraph that types were imported
from will result in a query error. The error that a non-nullable field resolved
to null bubbles up to the next nullable parent, in accordance with the <a href="https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/draft/#sec-Errors.Error-result-format">GraphQL
Spec</a>.</p>
<p>Until the network is reality, we are dealing with individual Graph Nodes and
querying subgraphs where imported entity types are not also indexed on the same
node should be handled with more tolerance. This RFC proposes that entity
reference fields that refer to imported types are converted to being optional in
the generated API schema. If the subgraph that the type is imported from is not
available on a node, such fields should resolve to <code>null</code>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#interfaces" id="interfaces">Interfaces</a></h3>
<p>Subgraph composition also supports interfaces in the ways outlined below.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#interfaces-can-be-imported-from-other-subgraphs" id="interfaces-can-be-imported-from-other-subgraphs">Interfaces Can Be Imported From Other Subgraphs</a></h4>
<p>The syntax for this is the same as that for importing types:</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">type _Schema_

<h4><a class="header" href="#implementation-concerns-for-interface-support" id="implementation-concerns-for-interface-support">Implementation Concerns For Interface Support</a></h4>
<p>Querying across types from different subgraphs that implement the same interface
may require a smart algorithm, especially when it comes to pagination. For
instance, if the first 1000 entities for an interface are queried, this range of
1000 entities may be divided up between different local and imported types
arbitrarily.</p>
<p>A naive algorithm could request 1000 entities from each subgraph, applying the
selected filters and order, combine the results and cut off everything after the
first 1000 items. This would generate a minimum of requests but would involve
significant overfetching.</p>
<p>Another algorithm could just fetch the first item from each subgraph, then based
on that information, divide up the range in more optimal ways than the previous
algorith, and satisfy the query with more requests but with less overfetching.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#compatibility" id="compatibility">Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>Subgraph composition is a purely additive, non-breaking change. Existing
subgraphs remain valid without any migrations being necessary.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#drawbacks-and-risks" id="drawbacks-and-risks">Drawbacks And Risks</a></h2>
<p>Reasons that could speak against implementing this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Schema parsing and validation becomes more complicated. Especially validation
of imported schemas may not always be possible, depending on whether and when
the referenced subgraph is available on the Graph Node or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query execution becomes more complicated. The subgraph a type belongs to must
be identified and local as well as imported versions of extended entities have
to be queried separately and be merged before returning data to the client.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#alternatives" id="alternatives">Alternatives</a></h2>
<p>No alternatives have been considered.</p>
<p>There are other ways to compose subgraph schemas using GraphQL technologies such
as <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/schema-stitching/">schema
stitching</a>
or <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/federation/introduction/">Apollo
Federation</a>.
However, schema stitching is being deprecated and Apollo Federation requires a
centralized server to serve to extend and merge GraphQL API. Both of these
solutions slow down queries.</p>
<p>Another reason not to use these is that GraphQL will only be <em>one</em> of several
query languages supported in the future. Composition therefore has to be
implemented in a query-language-agnostic way.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#open-questions" id="open-questions">Open Questions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Right now, interfaces require unique IDs across all the concrete entity types
that implement them. This is not something we can guarantee any longer if
these concrete types live in different subgraphs. So we have to handle this at
query time (or must somehow disallow it, returning a query error).</p>
<p>It is also unclear how an individual interface entity lookup would look like
if IDs are no longer guaranteed to be unique:</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">someInterface(id: &quot;?????&quot;) {

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-1" id="summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>This RFC proposes the creation of a local Ethereum tracing cache to speed up indexing of subgraphs which use block and/or call handlers.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#motivation" id="motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>When indexing a subgraph that uses block and/or call handlers, it is necessary to extract calls from the trace of each block that a Graph Node indexes. It is expensive to acquire and process traces from Ethereum nodes in both money and time.</p>
<p>When developing a subgraph it is common to make changes and deploy those changes to a production Graph Node for testing. Each time a change is deployed, the Graph Node must re-sync the subgraph using the same traces that were used for the previous sync of the subgraph. The cost of acquiring the traces each time a change is deployed impacts a subgraph developer's ability to iterate and test quickly.</p>

<p><em>Ethereum cache</em>: The new API proposed here.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#detailed-design-1" id="detailed-design-1">Detailed Design</a></h2>
<p>There is an existing <code>EthereumCallCache</code> for caching <code>eth_call</code> built into Graph Node today. This cache will be extended to support traces, and renamed to <code>EthereumCache</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#compatibility-1" id="compatibility-1">Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>This change is backwards compatible. Existing code can continue to use the parity tracing API. Because the cache is local, each indexing node may delete the cache should the format or implementation of caching change. In this case of invalidated cache the code will fall back to existing methods for retrieving a trace and repopulating the cache.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#drawbacks-and-risks-1" id="drawbacks-and-risks-1">Drawbacks and Risks</a></h2>
<p>Subgraphs which are not being actively developed will incur the overhead for storing traces, but will not ever reap the benefits of ever reading them back from the cache.</p>
<p>If this drawback is significant, it may be necessary to extend <code>EthereumCache</code> to provide a custom score for cache invalidation other than the current date. For example, <code>trace_filter</code> calls could be invalidated based on the latest update time for a subgraph requiring the trace. It is expected that a subgraph which has been updated recently is more likely to be updated again soon then a subgraph which has not been recently updated.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-2" id="summary-2">Summary</a></h2>
<p>GraphQL mutations allow developers to add executable functions to their schema. Callers can invoke these functions using GraphQL queries. An introduction to how mutations are defined and work can be found <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#mutations">here</a>. This RFC will assume the reader understands how to use GraphQL mutations in a traditional Web2 application. This proposal describes how mutations are added to The Graph's toolchain, and used to replace Web3 write operations the same way The Graph has replaced Web3 read operations.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#goals--motivation-1" id="goals--motivation-1">Goals &amp; Motivation</a></h2>
<p>The Graph has created a read semantic layer that describes smart contract protocols, which has made it easier to build applications on top of complex protocols. Since dApps have two primary interactions with Web3 protocols (reading &amp; writing), the next logical addition is write support.</p>
<p>Protocol developers that use a subgraph still often publish a Javascript wrapper library for their dApp developers (examples: <a href="https://github.com/daostack/client">DAOstack</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs">ENS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/livepeer/livepeerjs/tree/master/packages/sdk">LivePeer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/makerdao/dai.js/tree/dev/packages/dai">DAI</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-sdk">Uniswap</a>). This is done to help speed up dApp development and promote consistency with protocol usage patterns. With the addition of mutations to the Graph Protocol's GraphQL tooling, Web3 reading &amp; writing can now both be invoked through GraphQL queries. dApp developers can now simply refer to a single GraphQL schema that defines the entire protocol.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#urgency-2" id="urgency-2">Urgency</a></h2>
<p>This is urgent from a developer experience point of view. With this addition, it eliminates the need for protocol developers to manually wrap GraphQL query interfaces alongside developer-friendly write functions. Additionally, mutations provide a solution for optimistic UI updates, which is something dApp developers have been seeking for a long time (see <a href="https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/21">here</a>). Lastly with the whole protocol now defined in GraphQL, existing application layer code generators can now be used to hasten dApp development (<a href="https://dev.to/graphqleditor/top-3-graphql-code-generators-1gnj">some examples</a>).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#terminology-2" id="terminology-2">Terminology</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Mutations</em>: Collection of mutations.</li>
<li><em>Mutation</em>: A GraphQL mutation.</li>
<li><em>Mutations Schema</em>: A GraphQL schema that defines a <code>type Mutation</code>, which contains all mutations. Additionally this schema can define other types to be used by the mutations, such as <code>input</code> and <code>interface</code> types.</li>
<li><em>Mutations Manifest</em>: A YAML manifest file that is used to add mutations to an existing subgraph manifest. This manifest can be stored in an external YAML file, or within the subgraph manifest's YAML file under the <code>mutations</code> property.</li>
<li><em>Mutation Resolvers</em>: Code module that contains all resolvers.</li>
<li><em>Resolver</em>: Function that is used to execute a mutation's logic.</li>
<li><em>Mutation Context</em>: A context object that's created for every mutation that's executed. It's passed as the 3rd argument to the resolver function.</li>
<li><em>Mutation States</em>: A collection of mutation states. One is created for each mutation being executed in a given query.</li>
<li><em>Mutation State</em>: The state of a mutation being executed. Also referred to in this document as &quot;<em>State</em>&quot;. It is an aggregate of the core &amp; extended states (see below). dApp developers can subscribe to the mutation's state upon execution of the mutation query. See the <code>useMutation</code> examples below.</li>
<li><em>Core State</em>: Default properties present within every mutation state. Some examples: <code>events: Event[]</code>, <code>uuid: string</code>, and <code>progress: number</code>.</li>
<li><em>Extended State</em>: Properties the mutation developer defines. These are added alongside the core state properties in the mutation state. There are no bounds to what a developer can define here. See examples below.</li>
<li><em>State Events</em>: Events emitted by mutation resolvers. Also referred to in this document as &quot;<em>Events</em>&quot;. Events are defined by a <code>name: string</code> and a <code>payload: any</code>. These events, once emitted, are given to reducer functions which then update the state accordingly.</li>
<li><em>Core Events</em>: Default events available to all mutations. Some examples: <code>PROGRESS_UPDATE</code>, <code>TRANSACTION_CREATED</code>, <code>TRANSACTION_COMPLETED</code>.</li>
<li><em>Extended Events</em>: Events the mutation developer defines. See examples below.</li>
<li><em>State Reducers</em>: A collection of state reducer functions.</li>
<li><em>State Reducer</em>: Reducers are responsible for translating events into state updates. They take the form of a function that has the inputs [event, current state], and returns the new state post-event. Also referred to in this document as &quot;<em>Reducer(s)</em>&quot;.</li>
<li><em>Core Reducers</em>: Default reducers that handle the processing of the core events.</li>
<li><em>Extended Reducers</em>: Reducers the mutation developer defines. These reducers can be defined for any event, core or extended. The core &amp; extended reducers are run one after another if both are defined for a given core event. See examples below.</li>
<li><em>State Updater</em>: The state updater object is used by the resolvers to dispatch events. It's passed to the resolvers through the mutation context like so: <code>context.graph.state</code>.</li>
<li><em>State Builder</em>: An object responsible for (1) initializing the state with initial values and (2) defining reducers for events.</li>
<li><em>Core State Builder</em>: A state builder that's defined by default. It's responsible for initializing the core state properties, and processing the core events with its reducers.</li>
<li><em>Extended State Builder</em>: A state builder defined by the mutation developer. It's responsible for initializing the extended state properties, and processing the extended events with its reducers.</li>
<li><em>Mutations Config</em>: Collection of config properties required by the mutation resolvers. Also referred to in this document as &quot;<em>Config</em>&quot;. All resolvers share the same config. It's passed to the resolver through the mutation context like so: <code>context.graph.config</code>.</li>
<li><em>Config Property</em>: A single property within the config (ex: ipfs, ethereum, etc).</li>
<li><em>Config Generator</em>: A function that takes a config argument, and returns a config property. For example, &quot;localhost:5001&quot; as a config argument gets turned into a new IPFS client by the config generator.</li>
<li><em>Config Argument</em>: An initialization argument that's passed into the config generator function. This config argument is provided by the dApp developer.</li>
<li><em>Optimistic Response</em>: A response given to the dApp that predicts what the outcome of the mutation's execution will be. If it is incorrect, it will be overwritten with the actual result.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="header" href="#detailed-design-2" id="detailed-design-2">Detailed Design</a></h2>
<p>The sections below illustrate how a developer would add mutations to an existing subgraph, and then add those mutations to a dApp.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#mutations-manifest" id="mutations-manifest">Mutations Manifest</a></h3>
<p>The subgraph manifest (<code>subgraph.yaml</code>) now has an extra property named <code>mutations</code> which is the mutations manifest.</p>
<p><code>subgraph.yaml</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">specVersion: ...
...
mutations:
  repository: https://npmjs.com/package/...
  schema:
    file: ./mutations/schema.graphql
  resolvers:

    kind: javascript/es5
    file: ./mutations/index.js
    types: ./mutations/index.d.ts
dataSources: ...

</code></pre>
<p>Alternatively, the mutation manifest can be external like so:<br />
<code>subgraph.yaml</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">specVersion: ...
...
mutations:
  file: ./mutations/mutations.yaml
dataSources: ...
...
</code></pre>
<p><code>mutations/mutations.yaml</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">specVersion: ...

schema:
  file: ./schema.graphql
resolvers:
  apiVersion: 0.0.1
  kind: javascript/es5
  file: ./index.js
  types: ./index.d.ts
</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: <code>resolvers.types</code> is required. More on this below.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#mutations-schema" id="mutations-schema">Mutations Schema</a></h3>
<p>The mutations schema defines all of the mutations in the subgraph. The mutations schema builds on the subgraph schema, allowing the use of types from the subgraph schema, as well as defining new types that are used only in the context of mutations. For example, starting from a base subgraph schema:<br />
<code>schema.graphql</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">type MyEntity @entity {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  value: BigInt!
}
</code></pre>
<p>Developers can define mutations that reference these subgraph schema types. Additionally new <code>input</code> and <code>interface</code> types can be defined for the mutations to use:<br />
<code>mutations/schema.graphql</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">input MyEntityOptions {
  name: String!
  value: BigInt!
}

interface NewNameSet {
  oldName: String!
  newName: String!
}

type Mutation {
  createEntity(
    options: MyEntityOptions!
  ): MyEntity!

  setEntityName(
    entity: MyEntity!
    name: String!
  ): NewNameSet!
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>graph-cli</code> handles the parsing and validating of these two schemas. It verifies that the mutations schema defines a <code>type Mutation</code> and that all of the mutations within it are defined in the resolvers module (see next section).</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#mutation-resolvers" id="mutation-resolvers">Mutation Resolvers</a></h3>
<p>Each mutation within the schema must have a corresponding resolver function defined. Resolvers will be invoked by whatever engine executes the mutation queries (ex: Apollo Client). They are executed locally within the client application.</p>
<p>Mutation resolvers of kind <code>javascript/es5</code> take the form of an ES5 javascript module. This module is expected to have a default export that contains the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>resolvers: MutationResolvers</code> - The mutation resolver functions. The shape of this object must match the shape of the <code>type Mutation</code> defined above. See the example below for demonstration of this. Resolvers have the following prototype, <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/9dba58eeb6e28031bec7594b6df34c4fd74459b0/src/type/definition.js#L906">as defined in graphql-js</a>:</p>

<p>The existing alternative that protocol developers are creating for dApp developers has been described above.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#open-questions-2" id="open-questions-2">Open Questions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>How can mutations pickup where they left off in the event of an abrupt application shutdown?</strong>
Since mutations can contain many different steps internally, it would be ideal to be able to support continuing resolver execution in the event the dApp abruptly shuts down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How can dApps understand what steps a given mutation will take during the course of its execution?</strong>
dApps may want to present to the user friendly progress updates, letting them know a given mutation is 3/4ths of the way through its execution (for example) and a high level description of each step. I view this as closely tied to the previous open question above, as we could support continuing resolver executions if we know what step it's currently undergoing. A potential implementation could include adding a <code>steps: Step[]</code> property to the core state, where <code>Step</code> looks similar to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-typescript">interface Step {
  id: string
  title: string
  description: string
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'error' | 'finished'
  current: boolean
  error?: Error
  data: any
}
</code></pre>
<p>This, plus a few core events &amp; reducers, would be all we need to render UIs like the ones seen here: https://ant.design/components/steps/</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Should dApps be able to define event handlers for mutation events?</strong>
dApps may want to implement their own handlers for specific events emitted from mutations. These handlers would be different from the reducers, as we wouldn't want them to be able to modify the state. Instead they could store their own state elsewhere within the dApp based on the events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Should the Graph Node's schema introspection endpoint respond with the &quot;full&quot; schema, including the mutations' schema?</strong>
Developers could fetch the &quot;full&quot; schema by looking up the subgraph's manifest, read the <code>mutations.schema.file</code> hash value, and fetching the full schema from IPFS. Should the graph-node support querying this full schema directly from the graph-node itself through the introspection endpoint?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Will server side execution ever be a reality?</strong>
I have not thought of a trustless solution to this, am curious if anyone has any ideas of how we could make this possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Will The Graph Explorer support mutations?</strong>
We could have the explorer client-side application dynamically fetch and include mutation resolver modules. Configuring the resolvers module dynamically is problematic though. Maybe there are a few known config properties that the explorer client supports, and for all others it allows the user to input config arguments (if they're base types).</p>

<p>Engineering Plans are plans to turn an <a href="engineering-plans/../rfcs/index.html">RFC</a> into an
implementation in the core Graph Protocol tools like Graph Node, Graph CLI and
Graph TS. Every substantial development effort that follows an RFC is planned in

<h3><a class="header" href="#1-create-a-new-engineering-plan" id="1-create-a-new-engineering-plan">1. Create a new Engineering Plan</a></h3>
<p>Like RFCs, Engineering Plans are numbered, starting at <code>0001</code>. To create a new
plan, create a new branch of the <code>rfcs</code> repository. Check the existing plans to
identify the next number to use. Then, copy the <a href="https://github.com/graphprotocol/rfcs/blob/master/engineering-plans/0000-template.md">Engineering Plan
template</a>
to a new file in the <code>engineering-plans/</code> directory. For example:</p>

<p>Write the Engineering Plan, commit it to the branch and open a <a href="https://github.com/graphprotocol/rfcs/pulls">pull
request</a> in the <code>rfcs</code> repository.</p>
<p>In addition to the Engineering Plan itself, the pull request must include the
following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>a link to the Engineering Plan on the <a href="engineering-plans/./approved.html">Approved Engineering Plans</a> page, and</li>

<h2><a class="header" href="#implementation-details-for-prefetch-queries" id="implementation-details-for-prefetch-queries">Implementation Details for prefetch queries</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#goal" id="goal">Goal</a></h3>
<p>For a GraphQL query of the form</p>
<pre><code class="language-graphql">query {
  parents(filter) {
    id
    children(filter) {
      id
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>we want to generate only two SQL queries: one to get the parents, and one
to get the children for all those parents. The fact that <code>children</code> is
nested under <code>parents</code> requires that we add a filter to the <code>children</code>
query that restricts children to those that are related to the parents we
fetched in the first query to get the parents. How exactly we filter the
<code>children</code> query depends on how the relationship between parents and
children is modeled in the GraphQL schema, and on whether one (or both) of
the types involved are interfaces.</p>
<p>The rest of this writeup is concerned with how to generate the query for
<code>children</code>, assuming we already retrieved the list of all parents.</p>
<p>The bulk of the implementation of this feature can be found in
<code>graphql/src/store/prefetch.rs</code>, <code>store/postgres/src/jsonb_queries.rs</code>, and
<code>store/postgres/src/relational_queries.rs</code></p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#handling-firstskip" id="handling-firstskip">Handling first/skip</a></h3>
<p>We never get all the <code>children</code> for a parent; instead we always have a
<code>first</code> and <code>skip</code> argument in the children filter. Those arguments need to
be applied to each parent individually by ranking the children for each
parent according to the order defined by the <code>children</code> query. If the same
child matches multiple parents, we need to make sure that it is considered
separately for each parent as it might appear at different ranks for
different parents. In SQL, we use the <code>rank()</code> window function for this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">select *
  from (
    select c.*,
           rank() over (partition by parent_id order by ...) as pos
      from (query to get children) c)
 where pos &gt;= skip and pos &lt; skip + first
</code></pre>
<h3><a class="header" href="#handling-interfaces" id="handling-interfaces">Handling interfaces</a></h3>
<p>If <code>parents</code> or <code>children</code> (or both) are interfaces, we resolve the
interfaces into the concrete types implementing them, produce a query for
each combination of parent/child concrete type and combine those queries
via <code>union all</code>.</p>
<p>Since implementations of the same interface will generally differ in the schema
they use, we can not form a <code>union all</code> of all the data in the tables for
these concrete types, but have to first query only attributes that we know
will be common to all entities implementing the interface, most notably the
<code>vid</code> (a unique identifier that identifies the precise version of an
entity), and then later fill in the details of each entity by converting it
directly to JSON.</p>
<p>That means that when we deal with children that are an interface, we will
first select only the following columns (where exactly they come from
depends on how the parent/child relationship is modeled)</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">select '{__typename}' as entity, c.vid, c.id, parent_id
</code></pre>
<p>and form the <code>union all</code> of these queries. We then use that union to rank
children as described above.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#handling-parentchild-relationships" id="handling-parentchild-relationships">Handling parent/child relationships</a></h3>
<p>How we get the children for a set of parents depends on how the
relationship between the two is modeled. The interesting parameters there
are whether parents store a list or a single child, and whether that field
is derived, together with the same for children.</p>
<p>There are a total of 16 combinations of these four boolean variables; four
of them, when both parent and child derive their fields, are not
permissible. It also doesn't matter whether the child derives its parent
field: when the parent field is not derived, we need to use that since that
is the only place that contains the parent -&gt; child relationship. When the
parent field is derived, the child field can not be a derived field.</p>
<p>That leaves us with the following combinations of whether the parent and
child store a list or a scalar value, and whether the parent is derived:</p>
<p>For details on the GraphQL schema for each row in this table, see the
section at the end. The <code>Join cond</code> indicates how we can find the children
for a given parent. There are four different join conditions in this table.</p>
<p>When we query children, we need to have the id of the parent that child is
related to (and list the child multiple times if it is related to multiple
parents) since that is the field by which we window and rank children.</p>
<p>For join conditions of type C and D, the id of the parent is not stored in
the child, which means we need to join with the <code>parents</code> table.</p>
<p>Let's work out the details of these queries; the implementation uses
<code>struct EntityLink</code> in <code>graph/src/components/store.rs</code> to distinguish
between the different types of joins and queries.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#putting-it-all-together" id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</a></h3>
<p>Note that in all of these queries, we ultimately return the typename of
each entity, together with a JSONB representation of that entity. We do
this for two reasons: first, because different child tables might have
different schemas, which precludes us from taking the union of these child
tables, and second, because Diesel does not let us execute queries where
the type and number of columns in the result is determined dynamically.</p>
<p>We need to to be careful though to not convert to JSONB too early, as that
is slow when done for large numbers of rows. Deferring conversion is
responsible for some of the complexity in these queries.</p>
<p>In the following, we only go through the queries for relational storage;
for JSONB storage, there are similar considerations, though they are
somewhat simpler as the <code>union all</code> in the below queries turns into
an <code>entity = any(..)</code> clause with JSONB storage, and because we do not need
to convert to JSONB data.</p>
<p>Note that for the windowed queries below, the entity we return will have
<code>parent_id</code> and <code>pos</code> attributes. The <code>parent_id</code> is necessary to attach
the query result to the right parents we already have in memory. The JSONB
queries need to somehow insert the <code>parent_id</code> field into the JSONB data
they return.</p>
<p>In the most general case, we have an <code>EntityCollection::Window</code> with
multiple windows. The query for that case is</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">with matches as (
  -- Limit the matches for each parent
  select c.*
    from (
      -- Rank matching children for each parent
      select c.*,
             rank() over (partition by c.parent_id order by {query.order}) as pos
        from (
          {window.children_uniform(sort_key, block)}
          union all
            ... range ober all windows) c) c
   where c.pos &gt; {skip} and c.pos &lt;= {skip} + {first})
-- Get the full entity for each match
select m.entity, to_jsonb(c.*) as data, m.parent_id, m.pos
  from matches m, {window.child_table()} c
 where c.vid = m.vid and m.entity = '{window.child_type}'
 union all
       ... range over all windows
 -- Make sure we return the children for each parent in the correct order
 order by parent_id, pos
</code></pre>
<p>When there is only one window, we can simplify the above query. The
simplification basically inlines the <code>matches</code> CTE. That is important as
CTE's in Postgres before Postgres 12 are optimization fences, even when
they are only used once. We therefore reduce the two queries that Postgres
executes above to one for the fairly common case that the children are not
an interface.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">select '{window.child_type}' as entity, to_jsonb(c.*) as data
  from (
    -- Rank matching children
    select c.*,
          rank() over (partition by c.parent_id order by {query.order}) as pos
     from ({window.children_detailed()}) c) c
 where c.pos &gt;= {window.skip} and c.pos &lt;= {window.skip} + {window.first}
 order by c.parent_id,c.pos
</code></pre>
<p>When we do not have to window, but only deal with an
<code>EntityCollection::All</code> with multiple entity types, we can simplify the
query by avoiding ranking and just using an ordinary <code>order by</code> clause:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">with matches as (
  -- Get uniform info for all matching children
  select '{entity_type}' as entity, id, vid, {sort_key}
    from {entity_table} c
   where {query_filter}
   union all
     ... range over all entity types
   order by {sort_key} offset {query.skip} limit {query.first})
-- Get the full entity for each match
select m.entity, to_jsonb(c.*) as data, c.id, c.{sort_key}
  from matches m, {entity_table} c
 where c.vid = m.vid and m.entity = '{entity_type}'
 union all
       ... range over all entity types
 -- Make sure we return the children for each parent in the correct order
     order by c.{sort_key}, c.id
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, for the very common case of a GraphQL query without nested
children that uses a concrete type, not an interface, we can further
simplify this, again by essentially inlining the <code>matches</code> CTE to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">select '{entity_type}' as entity, to_jsonb(c.*) as data
  from {entity_table} c
 where query.filter()
 order by {query.order} offset {query.skip} limit {query.first}
</code></pre>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-3" id="summary-3">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Implements RFC-0002: Ethereum Tracing Cache</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#implementation" id="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>These changes happen within or near <code>ethereum_adapter.rs</code>, <code>store.rs</code> and <code>db_schema.rs</code>.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#limitations" id="limitations">Limitations</a></h3>
<p>The problem of reorg turns out to be a particularly tricky one for the cache, mostly due to ranges of blocks being requested rather than individual hashes. To sidestep this problem, only blocks that are older than the reorg threshold will be eligible for caching.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are some subgraphs which may require traces from all or a substantial number of blocks and don't make effective use of filtering. In particular, subgraphs which specify a call handler without a contract address fall into this category. In order to prevent the cache from bloating, any use of Ethereum traces which does not filter on a contract address will bypass the cache.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#ethereumtracecache" id="ethereumtracecache">EthereumTraceCache</a></h3>
<p>The implementation introduces the following trait, which is implemented primarily by <code>Store</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused_variables)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use std::ops::RangeInclusive;
struct TracesInRange {
    range: RangeInclusive&lt;u64&gt;,
    traces: Vec&lt;Trace&gt;,
}

pub trait EthereumTraceCache: Send + Sync + 'static {
    /// Attempts to retrieve traces from the cache. Returns ranges which were retrieved.
    /// The results may not cover the entire range of blocks. It is up to the caller to decide
    /// what to do with ranges of blocks that are not cached.
    fn traces_for_blocks(contract_address: Option&lt;H160&gt;, blocks: RangeInclusive&lt;u64&gt;
        ) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn Future&lt;Output=Result&lt;Vec&lt;TracesInRange&gt;, Error&gt;&gt;&gt;;
    fn add(contract_address: Option&lt;H160&gt;, traces: Vec&lt;TracesInRange&gt;);
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h4><a class="header" href="#block-schema" id="block-schema">Block schema</a></h4>
<p>Each cached block will exist as its own row in the database in an <code>eth_traces_cache</code> table.</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused_variables)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>eth_traces_cache(id) {
  id -&gt; Integer,
  network -&gt; Text,
  block_number: Integer,
  contract_address: Bytea,
  traces -&gt; Jsonb,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>A multi-column index will be added on network, block_number, and contract_address.</p>
<p>It can be noted that in the <code>eth_traces_cache</code> table, there is a very low cardinality for the value of the network row. It is inefficient for example to store the string <code>mainnet</code> millions of times and consider this value when querying. A data oriented approach would be to partition these tables on the value of the network. It is expected that hash partitioning available in Postgres 11 would be useful here, but the necessary dependencies won't be ready in time for this RFC. This may be revisited in the future.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#valid-cache-range" id="valid-cache-range">Valid Cache Range</a></h4>
<p>Because the absence of trace data for a block is a valid cache result, the database must maintain a data structure indicating which ranges of the cache are valid in an <code>eth_traces_meta</code> table. This table also enables eventually implementing cleaning out old data.</p>
<p>This is the schema for that structure:</p>
<pre><pre class="playpen"><code class="language-rust">
<span class="boring">#![allow(unused_variables)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>id -&gt; Integer,
network -&gt; Text,
start_block -&gt; Integer,
end_block -&gt; Integer,
contract_address -&gt; Nullable&lt;Bytea&gt;,
accessed_at -&gt; Date,
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>When inserting data into the cache, removing data from the cache, or reading the cache, a serialized transaction must be used to preserve atomicity between the valid cache range structure and the cached blocks. Care must be taken to not rely on any data read outside of the serialized transaction, and for the extent of the serialized transaction to not span any async contexts that rely on any <code>Future</code> outside of the database itself. The definition of the <code>EthereumTraceCache</code> trait is designed to uphold these guarantees.</p>
<p>In order to preserve space in the database, whenever the valid cache range is added it will be added such that adjacent and overlapping ranges are merged into it.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#cache-usage" id="cache-usage">Cache usage</a></h3>
<p>The primary user of the cache is <code>EtheriumAdapter&lt;T&gt;</code> in the <code>traces</code> function. </p>
<p>The correct algorithm for retrieving traces from the cache is surprisingly nuanced. The complication arises from the interaction between multiple subgraphs which may require a subset of overlapping contract addresses. The rate at which indexing proceeds of these subgraphs can cause different ranges of the cache to be valid for a contract address in a single query.</p>
<p>We want to minimize the cost of external requests for trace data. It is likely that it is better to...</p>
<ul>
<li>Make fewer requests</li>
<li>Not ask for trace data that is already cached</li>
<li>Ask for trace data for multiple contract addresses within the same block when possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one flow of data which upholds these invariants. In doing so it makes a tradeoff of increasing latency for the execution of a specific subgraph, but increases throughput of the whole system.</p>
<p>Within this graph:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edges which are labelled refer to some subset of the output data.</li>
<li>Edges which are not labelled refer to the entire set of the output data.</li>
<li>Each node executes once for each contiguous range of blocks. That is, it merges all incoming data before executing, and executes the minimum possible times.</li>
<li>The example given is just for 2 addresses. The actual code must work on sets of addresses.</li>
</ul>

<p>This construction is designed to make the fewest number of the most efficient calls possible. It is not as complicated as it looks. The actual construction can be expressed as sequential steps with a set of filters preceding each step.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#useful-dependencies" id="useful-dependencies">Useful dependencies</a></h3>
<p>The feature deals a lot with ranges and sets. Operations like sum, subtract, merge, and find overlapping are used frequently. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nested_intervals">nested_intervals</a> is a crate which provides some of these operations.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#benchmark" id="benchmark">Benchmark</a></h3>
<p>A temporary benchmark will be added for indexing a simple subgraph which uses call handlers. The benchmark will be run in these scenarios:</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#summary-4" id="summary-4">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Remove JSONB storage from <code>graph-node</code>. That means that we want to remove
the old storage scheme, and only use relational storage going
forward. At a high level, removal has to touch the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>user subgraphs in the hosted service</li>
<li>user subgraphs in self-hosted <code>graph-node</code> instances</li>
<li>subgraph metadata in <code>subgraphs.entities</code> (see <a href="https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/issues/1394">this issue</a>)</li>
<li>the <code>graph-node</code> code base</li>
</ul>
<p>Because it touches so many areas and different things, JSONB storage
removal will need to happen in several steps, the last being actual removal
of JSONB code. The first three steps above are independent of each other
and can be done in parallel.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#implementation-1" id="implementation-1">Implementation</a></h2>
<h3><a class="header" href="#user-subgraphs-in-the-hosted-service" id="user-subgraphs-in-the-hosted-service">User Subgraphs in the Hosted Service</a></h3>
<p>We will need to communicate to users that they need to update their
subgraphs if they still use JSONB storage. Currently, there are ~ 580
subgraphs
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/lutter/2e7a7716b70b4144fe0b6a5f1c9066bc">list</a>)
belonging to 220 different organizations using JSONB storage. It is quite
likely that the vast majority of them is not needed anymore and simply left
over from somebody trying something out.</p>
<p>We should contact users and tell them that we will delete their subgraph
after a certain date (say 2020-02-01) <em>unless</em> they deploy a new version of
the subgraph (with an explanation why etc. of course) Redeploying their
subgraph is all that is needed for those updates.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#self-hosted-user-subgraphs" id="self-hosted-user-subgraphs">Self-hosted User Subgraphs</a></h3>
<p>We will need to tell users that the 'old' JSONB storage is deprecated and
support for it will be removed as of some target date, and that they need
to redeploy their subgraph.</p>
<p>Users will need some documentation/tooling to help them understand</p>
<ul>
<li>which of their deployed subgraphs still use JSONB storage</li>
<li>how to remove old subgraphs</li>
<li>how to remove old deployments</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="header" href="#subgraph-metadata-in-subgraphsentities" id="subgraph-metadata-in-subgraphsentities">Subgraph Metadata in <code>subgraphs.entities</code></a></h3>
<p>We can treat the <code>subgraphs</code> schema like a normal subgraph, with the
exception that some entities must not be versioned. For that, we will need
to adopt code that makes it possible to write entities to the store without
recording their version (or, more generally, so that there will only be one
version of the entity, tagged with a block range <code>[0,)</code>)</p>
<p>We will manually create the DDL for the <code>subgraphs.graphql</code> schema and run
that as part of a database migration. In that migration, we will also copy
the existing metadata from <code>subgraphs.entities</code> and
<code>subgraphs.entity_history</code> into their new tables.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#the-code-base" id="the-code-base">The Code Base</a></h3>
<p>Delete all code handling JSONB storage. This will mostly affect
<code>entities.rs</code> and <code>jsonb_queries.rs</code> in <code>graph-store-postgres</code>, but there
are also smaller things like that we do not need the annotations on
<code>Entity</code> to serialize them to the JSON format that JSONB uses.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#tests-1" id="tests-1">Tests</a></h2>
<p>Most of the code-level changes are covered by the existing test suite. The
major exception is that the migration of subgraph metadata needs to be
tested and checked manually, using a recent dump of the production
database.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#migration-1" id="migration-1">Migration</a></h2>
<p>See above on migrating data in the <code>subgraphs</code> schema.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#documentation-1" id="documentation-1">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>No user-facing documentation is needed.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#implementation-plan-1" id="implementation-plan-1">Implementation Plan</a></h2>
<p><em>No estimates yet as we should first agree on this general course of
action</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Notify hosted users to update their subgraph or have it deleted by date X</li>
<li>Mark JSONB storage as deprecated and announce when it will be removed</li>
<li>Provide tool to ship with <code>graph-node</code> to delete unused deployments and
unneeded subgraphs</li>
<li>Add affordance to not version entities to relational storage code</li>
<li>Write SQL migrations to create new subgraph metadata schema and copy
existing data</li>
<li>Delete old JSONB code</li>
<li>On start of <code>graph-node</code>, add check for any deployments that still use
JSONB storage and log warning messages telling users to redeploy (once
the JSONB code has been deleted, this data can not be accessed any more)</li>
